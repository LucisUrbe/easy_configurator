# easy_configurator

An easy Flutter project to generate a JSON with appropriate interactions with a GUI.

## Usage

Compile this project and try to play with it. JSON files are its only output results. Currently, only desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) are the targets of the project.

This project is demo-only and should never be used in any production environments. Any bugs will never be fixed even with any forms of report. The project has finished development, so no longer enhancements supported. The project has nothing to do with any network activities and deals with only local files, therefore not providing any possible solution about computer networking.

## Reference

See [sing-box configuration](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/configuration/).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
